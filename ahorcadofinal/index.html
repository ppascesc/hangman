            OBJECTIVE:<br>The objective of Hangman is to guess 
            a hidden word or phrase by guessing letters within a certain 
            number of attempts.<br><br>SETUP:<br>One player thinks of a word or 
            phrase and keeps it secret from the other player(s). The secret 
            word or phrase is represented by a series of dashes or underscores, 
            one for each letter or word to be guessed.<br><br>GAMEPLAY:<br>The player(s) 
            who guess the word will take turns guessing letters. For each turn, a 
            player guesses a letter of the alphabet that they think might be in the 
            word. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in its 
            correct position(s). If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part 
            of the hangman (such as a head, body, arms, and legs) is drawn.<br><br>
            THE GAME CONTINUES UNTIL:<br>The word is guessed correctly or the hangman 
            is completely drawn (i.e., the player has used up all their attempts).<br><br>
            WINNING AND LOSING:<br>Winning: The player who successfully guesses 
            the word before the hangman is completely drawn wins the game. <br>
            Losing: If the hangman is completely drawn before the word is guessed, 
            the player who was trying to guess the word loses.
